# GeneralMotors_TestApp

Design pattern: MVVM

Functionality:

	•	When the iOS app is launched, it should display a field to enter text and a button (can be placed anywhere on the screen) named “Search Artist”. 
	•	When an artist name is entered in the field and the button is tapped, a spinner should be shown until the data is downloaded. (use the above url to download artist data)
	•	 Once the data is available, the spinner should be dismissed, and a scrollable list of the artist’s tracks should be shown. Each item in the list should contain the following data:

artistName

trackName                                                  TrackPrice

releaseDate

primaryGenreName
